## Contributing
	To contribute, fork the repo and modify the .ai file.

	If I'm not wrong, at this moment the path is not closed, and I'm too lazy to do so. However Illustrator does not care, so forget about it.

	To modify icons, you can copy an existing one by holding ALT while moving the existing icon. 

	You will have to ungroup the icon to free the text, and ungroup it again to free the shadow and folding.
